## Overview 
CaptureMe is an app that allows a user to take an image of a business card and store it into their phone.

## Problem
We found that business individuals that go to meet up or events in thier industry, gather many business cards and have to hold on to them for long durations.  We figured that building something that allows them to store the business card in their phone made more logical sense.  This fixes that issue. :)

## Tools Used
CaptureMe was built on React.js and utlized many frameworks/libraries/APIs to make this possible.  We used the Google OCR API to capture the text of the business card, Mongo to store user information, Okta for user authentication, Express for routing the users to different paths
